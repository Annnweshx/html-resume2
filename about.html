<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Annwesha Debnath, and I believe that who I am has been shaped most by curiosity, resilience, and a desire to grow beyond my comfort zone. I’m someone who constantly seeks to understand the world—whether through asking questions, exploring new ideas, or learning from the people around me. This mindset has carried me through both challenges and achievements, and it continues to define the kind of person I strive to be.</p>

<p>From a young age, I’ve been drawn to solving problems. Whether it was taking apart broken toys to see how they worked or helping classmates understand difficult concepts, I found joy in discovering how things function and in helping others along the way. That natural curiosity evolved into a love for coding, which I continue to pursue both in and outside of school. I’m not afraid to ask "why" or "how," even when the answer isn’t easy—especially then.</p>

<p>Of course, my journey hasn’t always been smooth. One of the most defining experiences in my life was when I failed one of my exams in college and could not tell anybody about it as I was ashamed of it. It tested my confidence and forced me to confront failure. But instead of giving up, I chose to learn from it. I realized that growth often comes not when things go perfectly, but when they don’t—and you keep going anyway.</p>
